Despite attracting considerable interest, its detailed physiology are still unclear. When the genome of the RN1 strain was sequenced and annotated it facilitated construction of a theoretical metabolic model based on available in situ and axenic experimental data. This model proposes that under anaerobic conditions this organism accumulates preferentially long chain fatty acids as triacylglycerols which are respired when electron acceptors become available. Utilisation of trehalose and/or polyphosphate stores, or partial oxidation of long chain fatty acids may supply the energy required for anaerobic lipid uptake and storage. Comparing the genome sequence of this isolate with metagenomes from two full-scale wastewater treatment plants reveals high levels of shared sequence similarities, and few metabolic differences. Of those genes assigned a function, such differences are restricted largely to those involved in exopolysaccharide biosynthesis or mobile genetic elements. They also include genes for fructose metabolism and mercury resistance. The genomic information obtained here will provide the basis for future research into in situ gene expression and regulation, and give unparalleled insight into the ecophysiology of this unusual and biotechnologically important filamentous bacterium.'",,89.5,88.7,99.5,0.1,,"Good","2014-12-08T22:10:49.782Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

To broaden comprehensive understanding of Nitrospira, we report comparative genomic analysis of two Nitrospira strains (ND1 and NJ1 belonging to lineages I and II, respectively), previously isolated from a WWTP. Unexpectedly, genome of strain NJ1 lacked genes relevant to flagella and CRISPR-Cas systems, whereas most nitrifying bacteria including strain ND1 have these genome elements. Alternatively, strain NJ1 possesses a gene cluster of quorum sensing systems, not reported in previous Nitrospira genomic analyses. Moreover, a comparative analysis based on genes involved in nitrogen metabolism among all Nitrospira genomes, revealed that a urease locus of strain ND1 belonging to lineage I was obtained by horizontal gene transfer from Nitrospira lineage II, and that cytochrome c nitrite reductases were canonical nitrite reductases for nitrogen assimilation in Nitrospira.

This bi-phasic metabolism is key for the Competibacter to survive under the cyclic anaerobic-‘feast’: aerobic-‘famine’ regime of enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) wastewater treatment systems. As they do not contribute to phosphorus (P) removal, but compete for resources with the polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAO), thought responsible for P removal, their proliferation theoretically reduces the EBPR capacity. In this study, two complete genomes from Competibacter were obtained from laboratory-scale enrichment reactors through metagenomics. Phylogenetic analysis identified the two genomes, “Candidatus Competibacter denitrificans” and “Candidatus Contendobacter odensis”, as being affiliated with Competibacter-lineage sub-groups 1 and 5, respectively. Both have genes for glycogen and PHA cycling and for the metabolism of volatile fatty acids. Marked differences were found in their potential for the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) and Entner-Doudoroff (ED) glycolytic pathways, denitrification, nitrogen fixation, fermentation, trehalose synthesis and utilization of glucose and lactate. Genetic comparison of P metabolism pathways to sequenced PAOs, revealed the absence of the Pit phosphate transporter in the Competibacter-lineage genomes – identifying a key metabolic difference with the PAO physiology. These genomes are the first from any GAO organism and they provide new insights into the complex interaction and niche competition between PAOs and GAOs in EBPR systems.",,,,,,,"Good","2019-07-18T22:17:38.435Z","2019-07-18T22:17:38.435Z"

Members of the uncultured B45 phylotype, which is embraced within the phylum Chloroflexi, were recently shown to exhibit this morphology. Although these organisms are among the most abundant populations recorded in activated sludge processes, nothing is known about their metabolic characteristics. In this study, a genome sequence, representing the phylotype, was retrieved from a metagenome generated from an activated sludge WWTP plant. The genome consisted of two chromosomes and one plasmid, which were 4.0, 1.0, and 0.04 Mbps in size, respectively. A metabolic model was constructed for this organism, based on annotation of its genome, showing its ability to generate energy by aerobic respiration, utilizing oxygen, nitrite, or nitrous oxide as electron acceptors, or by fermentation of sugars. This model was validated partially in situ. The provisional name of Candidatus “Promineofilum breve” is proposed for this species.

Strain MMFC1T was isolated from a methanol-fed microbial fuel cell that had been inoculated with sludge obtained from a wastewater-treatment facility in a chemical plant. This strain grows by fermenting methanol to produce acetate under anaerobic conditions, while homoacetogenic growth is not observed. MMFC1T also grows on pyruvate and lactate but not on sugars and other organic acids. Cells are curved rods and motile, have peritrichous flagella, and form endospores. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence shows that strain MMFC1T is affiliated with the family Sporomusaceae, while the closest relative is Sporomusa ovata with nucleotide-sequence similarity of 94%. Major fatty acids are iso-C13:0 3OH, C16:1 w9c and iso-C17:0. On the basis of its physiological and phylogenetic features, a novel genus and species are proposed to accommodate strain MMFC1T, with the name Methylomusa anaerophila gen. nov., sp. nov.

It grows in a broad range of pH from 6.5 to 12 and has the capability to neutralize the external medium. To investigate the underlying principles of survival at varying pH, we carried out RNA-seq analysis of the bacteria grown at pH7 and pH10 by de novo assembly of transcripts. NGS assisted Comparative genomics and transcriptomics approach lead to the identification of a set of protein coding genes that may have evolved as a consequence of adaptation to alkaline environment. These acquired proteins primarily belong to transporters including Mrp and cadmium resistance class of proteins. Variation in the transcript levels for these genes was also observed at different pH. This integrative approach of genome sequencing, comparative genomics and transcriptome profiling provides insights into the mechanisms, which may have led to the evolution of a novel species as a by-product of industrialization.

A high redox potential reaction center is a prerequisite for the evolution of the water-oxidizing complex of photosystem II. Therefore it is likely that high-potential phototrophy originally evolved to oxidize alternative electron donors that utilized a simpler redox chemistry, such as nitrite or Mn. To determine whether nitrite could have played a role in the transition to high-potential phototrophy we sequenced and analyzed the genome of Thiocapsa KS1, a physiologically highly versatile gammaproteobacterium capable of anoxygenic phototrophic nitrite oxidation. We demonstrate that Thiocapsa KS1 does not utilize a high potential reaction center, eliminating nitrite as an intermediate in the evolution of high potential phototrophy. Additional analyses of the ancestral features of photosystem II strongly suggest that direct Mn2+ oxidation was the key intermediate in the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. Moreover, phylogenetic and biochemical analyses of the nitrite oxidoreductase (NXR) from Thiocapsa KS1 illuminate the complex evolutionary history of nitrification. Our results show that the NXR in Thiocapsa evolved from nitrite reductases independently of those in chemolithotrophic nitrite oxidizers. This suggests that at least three evolutionary trajectories led to the modern nitrite oxidizing bacteria.;Draft genome sequence of the phototrophic nitrite-oxidizing bacterium Thiocapsa sp. strain KS1",,96.7,93.7,,,,"Good","2019-07-18T15:28:10.790Z","2019-07-18T15:28:10.790Z"

However, the complicating the situation is the wastewater that many contaminated sites not only contain chromium, but also elevated levels of other chemicals, such as nitrate. Therefore, Serratia sp.CQMUS2 does indeed have exceptional abilities and it is a prospective candidate for remediation in environments where chromate contamination occurs together with other stressors . Here, we present the complete genome sequence of Serratia sp CQMUS2 and provide information about the genetic bases that establish its high-level chromium tolerance and chromium reduction. Furthermore, its genome sequence might elucidate the mechanism for adaptation to co-contaminates, and provide insight into the biotechnological exploitation of Serratia sp CQMUS2 for the remediation of other contaminates.","collected_by:Xiaohong",99.6,98,93,4.7,,"Good","2016-05-23T13:12:06.620Z","2016-05-23T13:12:06.620Z"
